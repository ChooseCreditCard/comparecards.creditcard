    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What a Credit Card Comparison Page Usually Shows</h2>
      <p>Card comparison pages are designed to summarise selected information from multiple products in a single view. Instead of replicating full product terms, they highlight key dimensions such as fees, rewards, protections, eligibility signals and network acceptance.</p>
      <p>Each comparison framework chooses what to emphasise. Some pages focus on rewards and bonuses, others on costs and protections, and others on specific use-cases such as travel, student life, rebuilding credit or business spending. Understanding this framing helps you read the table correctly.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Comparison Tables Are Typically Structured</h2>
      <p>Behind a comparison table there is usually a defined set of columns and rules that describe how each product is displayed. Common structural elements include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Core product identifiers</strong> – name, issuing bank, card network and whether the card is consumer, student, business or secured.</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing and fees</strong> – annual fees, selected interest rates, foreign transaction fees and a small set of other charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards and benefits</strong> – earn rates, bonus structures and a summary of notable protections or perks.</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility indicators</strong> – broad credit-score bands, residency or age requirements when such signals can be summarised.</li>
        <li><strong>Link behaviour</strong> – one or more links out to official issuer pages, documentation and application flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because comparison pages must stay readable, they cannot show every clause from the product’s full terms. They are best viewed as structured summaries that should always be read together with the official documentation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Ranking, Ordering and Filters</h2>
      <p>Comparison layouts often allow cards to be ordered or filtered according to one or more criteria. Examples include sorting by estimated annual fee, highlighting cards with no foreign transaction fees, or grouping products by rewards type.</p>
      <p>Documentation-style comparisons aim to make these rules transparent. A page may explain whether cards are listed alphabetically, whether some positions are editorially highlighted, or whether a specific scoring model is used to assign ranks or labels. This helps distinguish structured information from opinion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limitations and Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Any comparison has limitations. Not all products in the market will be included, and the information shown is constrained by space, update cycles and data availability. In addition, offers, pricing and eligibility criteria can change after a page has been published or updated.</p>
      <p>For that reason, comparison pages should not be treated as definitive or personalised advice. They are a starting point that can help you identify options to research further using the issuer’s own documentation, regulatory disclosures and, if needed, independent professional guidance.</p>
